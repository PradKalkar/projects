## Website Details: 
1. This is a free online encyclopedia which anyone can view and edit globally - similar to that of Wikipedias' - created using **Django**
2. The home page is a list of all wikipedia entries present till date. One can add new entries and also modify the existing content.
3. By clicking on random page, the website takes us to any random pages' content. Clicking Home takes us back to the home page. 
4. Each wikipedia entry is stored as a markdown file which is then converted to HTML for rendering when we visit that entry's page. 
5. We can also search for entries, if the search perfectly matches an entry, then we are directed to that entry's page otherwise we are presented with search results as per the search query. 

## Deployment -
