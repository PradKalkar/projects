In this project, I have tried to redesign the front end of google search. It may not exactly have the same appearance as Google but the search pages are same for my and that of Google's own.
In this project, I have observed what get parameters does google use in its query string when we do a search or image search or advanced search, and used those along with HTML Forms to make this project work.
