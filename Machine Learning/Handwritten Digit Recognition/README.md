In this project, I have implemented handwritten digit recognition by taking help of the programming assignments from the coursera's Machine learning course. In this project, I have done the recogition using two methods- one-vs-all classification and using a neural network. I have used a pretrained neural network in this case to make the predictions whereas the one-vs-all classifier is trained by me. We can see that the neural network makes better predictions as it can achieve complex hypothesis as compared to one-vs-all classification.
